<h1>Quadcopter Package Delivery, Parameter Sweeps</h1>
<!--introduction-->
<p>This example models a quadcopter that navigates a path to deliver a package. The body was designed in CAD and imported into Simscape Multibody. The electric motors capture the dynamics of the power conversion in an abstract manner to enable fast simulation. The package is released from the quadcopter when it reaches the final waypoint and the release criteria are met.</p>
<p>The design space for the quadcopter and the missions it performs is explored by conducting a set of parameter sweeps.</p>

%% Quadcopter Package Delivery, Parameter Sweeps
% 
% This example models a quadcopter that navigates a path to deliver a
% package. The body was designed in CAD and imported into Simscape
% Multibody.  The electric motors capture the dynamics of the power
% conversion in an abstract manner to enable fast simulation.  The package
% is released from the quadcopter when it reaches the final waypoint and
% the release criteria are met.
%
% The design space for the quadcopter and the missions it performs is
% explored by conducting a set of parameter sweeps.
